        <dt>About Sloths:</dt>
        <p>Sloths are from Central and South America. They mainly live in tropical rain forests. They eat things such as leaves and twigs throughout their day. They have an extremely low metabolic rate - meaning that they digest food at a slow rate. They spend a long time, up to 20 hours a day, sleeping. Sloths are known for being particularly slow and move only around 41 yards per day.</p>
        <p>They maintain a body temperature of anywhere between 86°F-93°F and go between shady and the sun to keep their temperature regulated. They also are very good swimmers and will sometimes come down from their place in trees to swim in puddles.</p>
