<h1>I really like headphones!</h1>  
<h3>This is all about my love for headphones. I have a lot of pairs of headphones. 
    Some of them are cheap and some of them are more expensive. Some of the ones I have cost 
    less than 15 dollars and they work really well!</h3>  

    <hr>

    <h3>They have to have the following:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>good sound quality</li>
<li>noise cancelling features</li>
<li>both bluetooth and some sort of connector</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have a number of different types of headphones. My favorite ones are my Cowin headphones. I've had three pairs of the course of the last several years. The first pair were unfortunatley destroyed in a car accident. I was maybe 14 or 15 and some woman ran a red light and hit my mother who was turning left. She hit us dead on, my side of the car specifically, and my headphones were destroyed. My second pair I got right after that and they lasted me until a few days ago. They just become old over time.  got my new ones in the mail yesterday. I was actually wearing them during class today. They're comfortable to wear and are great at blocking out outside noises.</p>
